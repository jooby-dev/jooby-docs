# GetBatteryStatus

The command to request status information from the sensor battery.

By default, the battery status is measured once per 24 hours.
The state of the battery physically cannot change dramatically.
Response to the request contains the latest measurement results.
This is enough to monitor the battery condition.


## Request

It's a command with a [three-bytes header](../message.md#command-with-a-three-bytes-header).

### Parameters

#### **voltage under low load**

Voltage under minimum load (sleep mode), value in `mV`. Typical value is about `3600` `mV`.
If the voltage value is `4095` `mV`, then the value is unknown.

#### **voltage under high load**

Voltage under load simulating transmission mode, value in `mV`. Typical value is about `3600` `mV`.
If the voltage value is `4095` `mV`, then the value is unknown.

#### **internal resistance**

Internal resistance of the battery in `mΩ`.
If the value of the internal resistance is `65535` `mOhm`, then the resistance is unknown.
Max value is about `60000` `mOhm`. Typical range is about `5000..28000` `mOhm`.

#### **temperature**

It's a signed number in degrees Celsius.

#### **remaining capacity**

It's the remaining battery capacity, where `254` is `100%`.
A value of `255` means that the remaining battery capacity is unknown.

#### **overconsumption for last 24 hours**

Flag is set when consumption over the last 24 hours was higher than estimated

#### **counter for exceeding average daily consumption**

Counter for exceeding average daily consumption.
