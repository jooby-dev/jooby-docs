# ExAbsHourMC

The command gives the absolute values from device channels for the specified hour and hourly difference.

This command is generated by the sensor and sent within a specified period without a request from the server when configured to issue half-hour consumption data.
It is generated by the sensor periodically instead of [HourMC](HourMC.md) in case the meter data was transferred to the sensor at the activation (setup) time.
The parameter `23` is used for this behavior.

It's a command with a [two-bytes header](../../message.md#command-with-a-two-bytes-header).

### Parameters

#### **date**

The command contains pulse counter of channels for this date.
<br>
[See details](../../types.md#packed-date).

#### **hours**

It`s full value of pulse counter with diff for each previous hours (8 hours if reporting data interval is set to 4 hours)
<br>
[See details](../../types.md#packed-hours).

#### **channels bit set**

[See details](../../types.md#channels-bit-set).
