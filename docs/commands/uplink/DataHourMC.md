# DataHourMC

This command is generated by the multichannel sensor and sent within a specified period without a request from the server when configured to issue half-hour consumption data.
The command contains the total value of the pulse counter for the specified hour and hourly difference, which is limited to `31-bit` size.

<br>
[See details](../../types.md#packed-hours).

#### **channels bit set**

[See details](../../types.md#channels-bit-set).

#### **channel values with diffs**
