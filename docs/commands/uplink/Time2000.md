# Time2000

A device with this command reports its current time.
It is sent immediately after device power on.
After it a device sends it periodically (once per 24 hours).


## Event

### Format

>  Size | Type      | Field
> ------|-----------|-------
>  1    | byte      | command id = `0x09`
>  1    | byte      | command size = `5`
>  1    | byte      | [sequence number](#sequence-number)
>  4    | uint32_be | [seconds](#seconds)

### Parameters

#### **sequence number**

It's the same sequence number last used in a time correction command ([SetTime2000](../SetTime2000.md) or [CorrectTime2000](../CorrectTime2000.md)).

Equals `0` in case it's the first event after the device start.

#### **seconds**

Seconds since year 2000.

For example the time `2023-04-03T14:01:17.000Z` is `1680530477` in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) representation.
Unix time for year 2000 is `946684800` so seconds since year 2000 is `1680530477` - `946684800` = `733845677`.

### Examples

 Field           | Value       | Dump
-----------------|-------------|------
 command id      | `9`         | `0x09`
 command size    | `5`         | `0x05`
 sequence number | `77`        | `0x4d`
 seconds         | `733845677` | `0x2B 0xBD 0x98 0xad`
